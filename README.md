# Over-Temperature Cutoff Switch for Gas Stove

This project is a DIY safety mechanism designed to detect high temperatures on a gas stove and automatically shut off the gas supply to prevent overheating or fire hazards.

## Features

- Temperature monitoring using a thermocouple or thermistor
- Microcontroller-based cutoff logic (Arduino/ESP32)
- Relay or solenoid to control gas valve
- Manual reset / override (optional)
- Visual or audio overheat alert (LED/Buzzer)

## Goals

- Design and test a safe, reliable temperature cutoff system
- Mount securely to a standard gas stove
- Operate autonomously with minimal power consumption
