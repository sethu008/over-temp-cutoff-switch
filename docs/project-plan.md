# Project Plan: Over-Temperature Cutoff Switch

## 1. Requirements
- Automatically stop gas flow if temperature exceeds 250Â°C
- Use heat-resistant components
- Mount sensor on stove surface near the burner

## 2. Components
- [ ] Thermocouple / NTC Thermistor
- [ ] Arduino Nano / ESP32 / analog circuit
- [ ] Relay or solenoid valve
- [ ] Power supply (5V / battery)
- [ ] LED/Buzzer for alert
- [ ] Heat-proof enclosure

## 3. Tasks
- [ ] Research temperature sensors
- [ ] Build breadboard circuit
- [ ] Write and test cutoff logic
- [ ] Design PCB or perfboard layout
- [ ] Final integration on stove

## 4. Safety Considerations
- Ensure isolation from gas piping
- Avoid overcurrent or thermal runaway
- Include a manual override
